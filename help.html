        <div class="question">
            <p>1. What is the difference between Arabica and Robusta coffee beans?</p>
           </div>
    
   
		<div class="answer">
			<p>Arabica beans are generally sweeter and softer in taste, with flavors of sugar, fruit, and berries. Their acidity is higher, with that winey taste that characterizes coffee with excellent acidity. Robusta, however, has a strong, harsh taste, with a grain-like overtone and peanutty aftertaste. They contain twice as much caffeine as Arabica beans, and they are generally considered to be of inferior quality.</p>
		</div>
	
	<div class="question">
		<p>2. How do you store coffee beans properly?</p>
		<div class="answer">
			<p>Coffee beans are best stored in a cool, dark place. Avoid storing them in direct sunlight or in a warm place, as this can cause them to lose their flavor quickly. It's also best to keep them in an airtight container to prevent them from absorbing moisture and odors from other foods.</p>

	<div class="question">
		<p>3. What is the ideal grind size for coffee?</p>
		<div class="answer">
			<p>The ideal grind size for coffee depends on the brewing method you are using. For a French press, a coarse grind is recommended. For a pour-over or drip coffee maker, a medium-fine grind is usually best. For an espresso machine, a fine grind is typically used.</p>
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="question">
		<p>4. How much coffee should you use per cup?</p>
		<div class="answer">
			<p>A general guideline is to use 1 to 2 tablespoons of coffee per six ounces of water. However, this can vary depending on your personal taste and the type of coffee you are using. Experiment with different ratios to find what works best for you.</p>
		</div>

	<div class="question">
		<p>5. What is the best way to clean a coffee maker?</p>
		<div class="answer">
			<p>To clean a coffee maker, start by running a solution of equal parts white vinegar and water through the machine. This will help to remove any mineral buildup and improve the taste of your coffee. After running the vinegar solution through the machine, run at least one or two cycles of plain water to rinse it out completely.</p>

	<div class="question">
		<p>6. What is the difference between cold brew and iced coffee?</p></div>
		<div class="answer">
			<p>Cold brew coffee is made by steeping coffee grounds in cold water for an extended period of time, typically 12 to 24 hours. This process results in a smooth, low-acidity coffee that is less. </p>
